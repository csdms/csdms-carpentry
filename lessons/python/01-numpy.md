While a lot of powerful tools are built into languages like Python,
even more tools exist in [libraries](reference.html#library).

In order to load the elevation data,
we need to [import](reference.html#import) a library called NumPy.
You should use this library if you want to do fancy things with numbers (ie. math),
especially if you have matrices or arrays.
We can load NumPy using:

~~~ {.python}
import numpy
~~~

Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a
storage locker and setting it up on the bench. Libraries provide
additional functionality to Python, much like a new piece of equipment
adds functionality to a lab space. Once we’ve loaded the library, we can
use a tool inside that library to read the data file:

~~~ {.python}
numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/topo.asc', delimiter=',')
~~~
~~~ {.output}
array([[ 3198.8391,  3198.123 ,  3197.1584, ...,  2583.3293, 
    2585.4368, 2589.1079], [ 3198.3306,  3197.5242,  3196.4102, ..., 
    2582.6992,  2584.9167, 2587.801 ], [ 3197.9968,  3196.9197, 
    3195.7188, ...,  2581.8328,  2583.8159, 2586.0325], ..., [
    3325.1509,  3334.7822,  3343.3154, ...,  2780.8191,  2769.3235,
    2762.373 ], [ 3325.0823,  3335.0308,  3345.4963, ...,  2775.3345, 
    2765.7131, 2759.6555], [ 3326.6824,  3336.5305,  3348.1343, ..., 
    2769.7661,  2762.5242, 2756.6877]])
~~~

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a [function call](reference.html#function-call)
that asks Python to run the function `loadtxt` that belongs to the `numpy` library.
This [dotted notation](reference.html#dotted-notation), with the syntax `thing.component`, is used
everywhere in Python to refer to parts of things.

The function call to `numpy.loadtxt` has two [parameters](reference.html#parameter):
the name of the file we want to read,
and the [delimiter](reference.html#delimiter) that separates values on a line.
Both need to be character strings (or [strings](reference.html#string), for short)
so we write them in quotes.

Within the Jupyter iPython notebook, pressing Shift+Enter runs the
commands in the selected cell. Because we haven't told iPython what to
do with the output of `numpy.loadtxt`, the notebook just displays it on
the screen. In this case, that output is the data we just loaded. By
default, only a few rows and columns are shown (with `...` to omit
elements when displaying big arrays).

Our call to `numpy.loadtxt` read the file but didn’t save it to memory.
In order to access the data, we need to [assign](reference.html#assignment) the values to a [variable](reference.html#variable).
A variable is just a name that refers to an object. Python’s variables
must begin with a letter and are [case sensitive](reference.html#case-sensitive). We can assign a
variable name to an object using `=`.

Let’s re-run numpy.loadtxt and assign the output to a variable name:


~~~ {.python}
topo = numpy.loadtxt('topo.asc', delimiter=',')
~~~

This command doesn’t produce any visible output. If we want to see the
data, we can print the variable’s value with the command `print`:


~~~ {.python}
print topo
~~~

~~~ {.output}
    [[ 3198.8391  3198.123   3197.1584 ...,  2583.3293  2585.4368 
    2589.1079] [ 3198.3306  3197.5242  3196.4102 ...,  2582.6992 
    2584.9167  2587.801 ] [ 3197.9968  3196.9197  3195.7188 ..., 
    2581.8328  2583.8159  2586.0325] ..., [ 3325.1509  3334.7822 
    3343.3154 ...,  2780.8191  2769.3235  2762.373 ] [ 3325.0823 
    3335.0308  3345.4963 ...,  2775.3345  2765.7131  2759.6555] [
    3326.6824  3336.5305  3348.1343 ...,  2769.7661  2762.5242 
    2756.6877]]

Using its variable name, we can see that [type](reference.html#type) of object the variable name `topo` is assigned 
to:

~~~ {.python}
print type(topo)
~~~

~~~ {.output}
    <type 'numpy.ndarray'>
~~~

The function `type` tells us that the variable name `topo` currently
points to an N-dimensional array created by the NumPy library. We can also get the shape of the
array:

~~~ {.python}
print topo.shape
~~~

~~~ {.output}
(500, 500)
~~~

This tells us that `topo` has 500 rows and 500 columns. The file
we imported contains elevation data (in meters, 2 degree spacing) for an
area along the Front Range of Colorado, so the area that this array represents is 1 km x 1 km.

The object of
type `numpy.ndarray` that the variable `topo` is assigned to contains the values of the array
as well as some extra information about the array. These are the [members](reference.html#member) or attributes of the object, and they
describe the data in the same way an adjective describes a noun. The
command `topo.shape` calls the `shape` attribute of the object with the variable name
`topo` that describes its dimensions. We use the same dotted notation
for the attributes of objects that we use for the functions inside
libraries because they have the same part-and-whole relationship.

## Plotting
 
Rasters are just big two dimensional arrays of values. In the case of DEMs, those values
are elevations. It's very hard to get a good sense of what this landscape
looks like by looking directly at the data. This information is better
conveyed through plots and graphics.

Data visualization deserves an entire lecture (or course) of its own,
but we can explore a few features of Python's `matplotlib` library here.
While there is no "official" plotting library in Python, this package is
the de facto standard.

We start by importing the `pyplot` module from the library `matplotlib`:

~~~{.python}
import matplotlib.pyplot
~~~

> ## Some IPython magic {.callout}
> 
> If you're using an IPython / Jupyter notebook, you'll need to execute
> the following command in order for the plots to appear in
> the notebook instead of a separate window:
> 
> ~~~{.python}
> %matplotlib inline
> ~~~
> 
> The `%` indicates an IPython magic function - a function that is only
> valid within the notebook environment. Note that you only have to
> execute this function once per notebook.

We can use the function `imshow` within `matplotlib.pyplot` to display arrays as a 2D
image:

~~~{.python}
matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(topo)
~~~
~~~{.output}
![png](fig/output_24_1.png)
~~~

## Indexing

We can access individual values in an array using an [index](reference.html#index) in square brackets:

~~~ {.python}
print 'elevation at the corner of topo:', topo[0,0], 'meters'
~~~
~~~ {.output}
elevation at the corner of topo: 3198.8391 meters
~~~

~~~ {.python}
print 'elevation at some random point in topo:', topo[137,65],
'meters'
~~~
~~~ {.output}
elevation at some random spot in topo: 3251.1179 meters
~~~

When referring to entries in a two dimensional array, the indices are
ordered `[row,column]`. The expression `topo[137, 65]` should not surprise
you but `topo[0,0]` might. Programming languages like Fortran and MATLAB
start counting at 1 because that’s what (most) humans have done for
thousands of years. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java,
Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that’s simpler for computers to
do. So if we have an M×N array in Python, the indices go from 0 to M-1
on the first axis (rows) and 0 to N-1 on the second (columns). In
MATLAB, the same array (or matrix) would have indices that go from 1 to
M and 1 to N. Zero-based indexing takes a bit of getting used to, but
one way to remember the rule is that the index is how many steps we have
to take from the start to get to the item we want.

Python also allows for negative indices to refer to the position of
elements with respect to the end of each axis. An index of -1 refer to
the last item in a list, -2 is the second to last, and so on. Since
index `[0,0]` is the upper left corner of an array, index `[-1,-1]`
therefore the lower right corner of the array:

~~~{.python}
print topo[-1,-1]
~~~
~~~{.output}
2756.6877
~~~

> ## In the Corner {.callout}
>
> What may also surprise you is that when Python displays an array,
> it shows the element with index `[0, 0]` in the upper left corner
> rather than the lower left.
> This is consistent with the way mathematicians draw matrices,
> but different from the Cartesian coordinates.
> The indices are (row, column) instead of (column, row) for the same reason,
> which can be confusing when plotting data.

>
> What does the following program print out?
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> first, second = 'Grace', 'Hopper'
> third, fourth = second, first
> print third, fourth
> ~~~

## Slicing

A command like `topo[0,0]` selects a single element in the array `topo`.
Indices can also be used to [slice](reference.html#slice) sections of the array. For example, we
can select the top left quarter of the array like this:

~~~ {.python}
print topo[0:5, 0:5]
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[[ 3198.8391  3198.123   3197.1584  3196.2017  3193.8813] [
    3198.3306  3197.5242  3196.4102  3194.7559  3191.9763] [ 3197.9968 
    3196.9197  3195.7188  3193.3855  3190.5371] [ 3198.054   3196.7031 
    3194.9573  3192.4451  3189.5288] [ 3198.3289  3196.9111  3195.335  
    3192.7874  3190.0085]]

~~~

The slice `[0:5]` means "Start at index 0 and go along the axis up to,
but not including, index 5".

We don’t need to include the upper or lower bound of the slice if we
want to go all the way to the edge. If we don’t include the lower bound,
Python uses 0 by default; if we don’t include the upper bound, the slice
runs to the end of the axis. If we don’t include either (i.e., if we
just use ‘:’), the slice includes everything:

~~~ {.python}
print topo[:len(topo)/2, len(topo)/2:]
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[[ 3008.1116  3012.2922  3015.3018 ...,  2583.3293  2585.4368 
    2589.1079] [ 3009.9558  3014.0007  3016.5647 ...,  2582.6992 
    2584.9167  2587.801 ] [ 3010.8604  3014.1228  3016.7412 ..., 
    2581.8328  2583.8159  2586.0325] ..., [ 3370.0918  3368.5371 
    3366.7148 ...,  2687.8396  2682.4326  2676.8521] [ 3370.478  
    3368.7561  3366.8923 ...,  2685.9941  2681.2888  2676.9924] [
    3371.2021  3369.3376  3367.3677 ...,  2687.7014  2685.5146 
    2683.1936]]
~~~

## Numerical operations on arrays

We can perform basic mathematical operations on each individual element
of a NumPy array. We can create a new array with elevations in feet:

~~~{.python}
topo_in_feet = topo * 3.2808
print 'Elevation in meters:', topo[0,0]
print 'Elevation in feet:', topo_in_feet[0,0]
~~~
~~~{.output}
Elevation in meters: 3198.8391
Elevation in feet: 10494.7513193
~~~

Arrays of the same size can be used together in arithmatic operations:

~~~{.python}
double_topo = topo + topo
print 'Double topo:', double_topo[0,0], 'meters'
~~~
~~~{.output}
Double topo: 6397.6782 meters
~~~

We can also perform statistical operations on arrays:

~~~{.python}
print 'Mean elevation:', topo.mean(), 'meters'
~~~
~~~{.output}
Mean elevation: 3153.62166407 meters
~~~

> ## Methods vs. attributes {.callout}
>

> 
> Python will kindly tell us if we mix up the parentheses:
> 
> ~~~{.python}

> ~~~
> ~~~{.output}

> call last)
> 
> <ipython-input-29-5f3a6f1ecafc> in <module>() ----> 1 topo.shape()
> 
> TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable
> ~~~

NumPy arrays have many other useful methods:


~~~{.python}
print 'Highest elevation:', topo.max(), 'meters'
print 'Lowest elevation:', topo.min(), 'meters' 
~~~

~~~{.output}
Highest elevation: 3831.2617 meters
Lowest elevation: 2565.0293 meters
~~~

We can also call methods on slices of the array:

~~~{.python}
half_len = int(len(topo) / 2)

print 'Highest elevation of NW quarter:', topo[:half_len,
:half_len].max(), 'meters'

print 'Highest elevation of SE quarter:', topo[half_len:,
half_len:].max(), 'meters' 
~~~

~~~{.output}
Highest elevation of NW quarter: 3600.709 meters
Highest elevation of SE quarter: 3575.3262 meters
~~~

Methods can also be used along individual axes (rows or columns) of an
array. If we want to see how the mean elevation changes with longitude
(E-W), we can use the method along `axis=0`:

~~~{.python}
print topo.mean(axis=0) 
~~~


To see how the mean elevation changes with latitude (N-S), we can use
`axis=1`:

~~~{.python}
print topo.mean(axis=1) 
~~~


## Plotting, take two
 
It's hard to get a sense of how the topography changes across the
landscape from these big tables of numbers. A simpler way to display
this information is with line plots.

We are again going to use the `matplotlib` package for data
visualization. Since we imported the `matplotlib.pyplot` library once
already, those tools are available and can be called within Python. As a
review, though, we are going to write every step needed to load and plot
the data.

We use the function `plot` to create two basic line plots of the
topography:

~~~{.python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

topo = np.loadtxt('topo.asc', delimiter=',')

plt.plot(topo[0,:])
plt.title('Topographic profile, northern edge')
plt.ylabel('Elevation (m)')
plt.xlabel('<-- West    East -->')
plt.show()

plt.plot(topo[-1,:], 'r--')
plt.title('Topographic profile, southern edge')
plt.ylabel('Elevation (m)')
plt.xlabel('<-- West    East -->')
plt.show() 
~~~

~~~{.output}
![png](output_74_0.png)

To better compare these profiles, we can plot them as separate lines in
a single figure using the argument `hold=True`, This will force all
subsequent calls to `plt.plot` to use the same axes (until it reaches
`plt.show()`). The argument `label=` holds the label that will appear in the legend.

~~~{.python}
import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

topo = np.loadtxt('topo.asc', delimiter=',')

plt.plot(topo[0,:], hold=True, label='North')

plt.plot(topo[-1,:], 'r--', label='South')

plt.plot(topo[len(topo)/2,:], 'g:', linewidth=3, label='Mid')

plt.title('Topographic profiles')
plt.ylabel('Elevation (m)')
plt.xlabel('<-- West    East -->')
plt.legend(loc = 'lower left')

plt.show()

>(or `set_ylabel()`) method. `plt.show()` is called after the entire
>figure is set up.
