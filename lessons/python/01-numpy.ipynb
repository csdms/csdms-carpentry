Programming languages like Fortran and MATLAB start counting at 1 because that’s what (most) humans have done for thousands of years. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that’s simpler for computers to do. So if we have an M×N array in Python, the indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis (rows) and 0 to N-1 on the second (columns). In MATLAB, the same array (or matrix) would have indices that go from 1 to M and 1 to N. Zero-based indexing takes a bit of getting used to, but one way to remember the rule is that the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get to the item we want."
